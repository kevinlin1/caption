Visit **[kevinl.info/caption/](https://kevinl.info/caption/)** to caption your speech using your browser's built-in speech recognition capabilities. Microphone permissions are required, but your data is handled entirely by your browser implementation. To clear the transcript, click anywhere in the captioning window area.
